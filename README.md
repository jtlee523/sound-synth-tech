# sound-synth-tech
This is the reposity for MUSI UN3261 Sound Synth Tech (Fall 2022).

The scaffold files (sound out, sound in, etc.) are in their own folder, but otherwise this repo is organized by week.

## Assignments
- The Simple Materials Patcher is in the Week 3 folder and is called "Simple.Materials.Patch.v01maxpat.maxpat"
- Week 6 has the two homework patches named how they were recommended in the assignment

## Notes
- I had a lot of issues with the Poly~ assignment. Mainly, I had no clue how to encorporate another envelope since in the Ring Mod we always take in a scalar and a cycle~ to multiply. The uploaded patch shows my attempt at the assignment but unforunately don't have too much more time to work on it (it's due tomorrow at this point.)
