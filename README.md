# sound-synth-tech
This is the reposity for MUSI UN3261 Sound Synth Tech (Fall 2022).

The scaffold files (sound out, sound in, etc.) are in their own folder, but otherwise this repo is organized by week.

## Assignments
- The Simple Materials Patcher is in the Week 3 folder and is called "Simple.Materials.Patch.v01maxpat.maxpat"
- Week 6 has the two homework patches named how they were recommended in the assignment
- See notes below for the week 6 notes

## Notes
- I had a lot of issues with the Poly~ assignment. Mainly, I had no clue how to encorporate another envelope since in the Ring Mod we always take in a scalar and a cycle~ to multiply. The uploaded patch shows my attempt at the assignment but unforunately don't have too much more time to work on it (it's due tomorrow at this point.) 
- I made two versions for the homework. The one that is names as recommended was supposed to be square wave ring modulation I couldn't get to work. The -onFM was a last ditched effort (done the morning of oct 24) to try to get an envelope working. I wasn't entirely sure if my poly~ or even how to deal with using a function and line~ to modify parameters was correct. I would love feedback on this because I now have 4 non-functional patches!
