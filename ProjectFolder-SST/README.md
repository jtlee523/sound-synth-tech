# Sound Synth Tech Final Project

The goal of this project is to create a sampler instrument. Ideally, I want to find way to interface this into logic.

However, a sampler is nothing new - that part of the project is simply pedagogical. What I plan to do after is use samples to create "new sounds." I was inspired by the FluCoMa patches using machine learning - I don't plan to use a neural network, but it could be nice to have parameter control to create new sounds. That, or find some way to "multiple" or "add" sounds together.
